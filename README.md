# demographic-model-far-east-countries-study
The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare the demographics of four countries: Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.
We will interpret the results obtained through graphs, on the basis of the socio-demographic characteristics and the history that distinguish the countries under study. In particular, we will focus on the evolution of mortality, fertility, life expectancy and related determinants.
